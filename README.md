# Soundseeker
A WIP tool for organizing and juxtaposing musical ideas in the form of short audio recordings

# why?

## a problem that needs solving:
The process of composing music is different for everyone, yet there exist some techniques and practices employed by many musicians. One such practice is that of recording a short clip on one's phone at the time the musical idea is first thought of. This allows the composer to capture many what would otherwise be fleeting ideas in a moment, simply by singing or playing it into their phone. However, this often leads to a lengthy catalogue of new idea recordings, organized chronoligically, that can be difficult to keep track of. Soundseeker allows the storage of these musical ideas not in chronological order, but in groupings that share some subjective relationship in the composer's mind.

## a great excuse to hone and apply full-stack web development skills
